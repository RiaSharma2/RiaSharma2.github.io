                <h1> <b> Re: Eileen Dover university application </b> </h1>

                <p> Dear Eileen, <br> Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <u> PhD </u> next year. I will answer your <br> questions one by one, in the following sections.
                </p>
                
                <h2> <b> Starting dates</b> </h2>

                <p> We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; <br> the start dates for each one are as follows:
                </p>
                 <p>
                        First semester: 9 September 2016
                        Second semester: 15 January 2017
                        Third semester: 2 May 2017
                </p>
                <p> Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer. </p>
                <p> You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com.">important university dates</a> on our website. </p>

                <h2> <b> Subjects of study </b></h2>

                <p> At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and <br> technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you <br> submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
                </p>
                <p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
                Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 
                × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.) <br> <u> HTML </u> and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.
            </p>
            <p> So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other
                  <br> resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

                  <h2> <b> Exotic dance moves </b> </h2>

                  <p> Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with <br> definitions: </p>

                  <p> Polynesian chicken dance <br> A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their <br> livestock to be "fruitful". <br> Icelandic brownian shuffle <br> 
                    Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the <br> floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance <br>
                    inspired modern styles such as Twerking. <br> Arctic robot dance <br> An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", <br>
                     stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br> because they were really cold. </p>

                     <p> For more of my research, see my <a href="http://example.com."> exotic dance research page.</a> </p>
                     <p> Yours sincerely, <br> Dr Eleanor Gaye</p>
